#Extension collection for Apophysis 7x

Apophysis 7x has, like the other forks of Apophysis, an extension system which allows the user to load custom variations into the program. These variations are provided as *dynamic link libraries* (*.dll) and can be written in any language which supports symbol export. This repository hosts those extensions, which have been developed by [xyrus-worx.org](http://apophysis.xyrus-worx.org) and work best with Apophysis 7x.
